Phase 1: Define interfaces or abstract classes for custom classes to implement.  Some are from java.util, others will need to be created locally.
Based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures#Abstract_data_types:
Abstract data types are:

Array*

Container

Map/Associative array/Dictionary

Multimap

List

Set

Multiset/Bag

Priority queue

Queue

Double Ended queue

Stack

String*

Tree

Graph

*already well implemented by Java

From java.util:

Deque<E> - "A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends."

List<E> - "An ordered collection (also known as a sequence)."

Map<K,V> - "An object that maps keys to values."

Queue<E> - "A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing."

All java.util interfaces also have abstract classes in java.util to help get started or to make easier.
