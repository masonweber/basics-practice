This repo is meant to be initialzed in the IDE project folder, if you use one.  

Using Netbeans: 
1. Create a new project and call it whatever you would like.
2. Initialize a Git repo in the top level of that project folder.
3. Use "git remote add xxxx https://www.github.com/masonweber/basics-practice.git" to add this repo as a remote source.
4. Use "git pull xxxx master" to sync.

If you would like to contribute to the project, fork this repo and make a pull request to merge changes in.  The creator can be reached at mason.weber.cpe@gmail.com.  There is no project management tool at this point in time.

Thanks and good luck!
